## What are Section Dividers?
- Imagine a well-written essay. It wouldn’t be a jumbled mess of words, right? Instead, it would be neatly divided into sections with clear headings, making it easier to understand and navigate. Section dividers in SwiftUI serve a similar purpose. They act as visual markers, grouping related functionalities and separating them from others. This makes your code more organized, easier to read at a glance, and ultimately, a joy to work with.


## Benefits of Using Section Dividers
- Enhanced Readability: Just like chapter breaks in a book, section dividers provide clear visual cues, making your code easier to scan and comprehend. It’s like having an outline for your code, allowing you to quickly grasp the overall structure and locate specific sections.
- Improved Maintainability: When you revisit your code later, or when someone else needs to work on it, section dividers act as helpful guides. They make it much easier to identify specific areas and modifications needed, saving valuable time and effort.
- Better Code Organization: Using section dividers encourages a more structured and organized coding style. This not only improves the immediate readability of your code but also promotes better long-term maintainability as your project grows.


## How to use them?
- To start using Section Dividers, we first need to enable the Minimap feature from the Adjust Editor Options button located at the top right corner within Xcode.
